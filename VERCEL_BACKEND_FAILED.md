# ❌ Vercel Backend Deployment Failed

## Problem

Backend deployed to Vercel returns 500 errors. Vercel's Python runtime doesn't support FastAPI.

## Solution

Deploy backend to **Render.com** instead (see RENDER_DEPLOYMENT.md)

**Frontend:** ✅ Working on Vercel  
**Backend:** ❌ Failed on Vercel → Deploy to Render.com

See RENDER_DEPLOYMENT.md for step-by-step instructions.
