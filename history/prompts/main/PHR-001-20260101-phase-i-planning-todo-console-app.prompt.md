## Prompt

# Phase I Planning Request: Todo In-Memory Python Console Application

## Constitutional Context
Operating under the "Evolution of Todo – 5-Phase Hackathon" Master Constitution.
This plan applies ONLY to Phase I.

## Phase Definition
**Phase I Name:** Todo In-Memory Python Console Application  
**Python Version:** Python 3.12.4  
**Primary Objective:** Design a complete, spec-driven plan to build a command-line Todo application that stores all data strictly in memory and demonstrates core CRUD functionality.

## Strict Phase I Scope

### MUST Include (Basic Level Features):
1. Add Task
2. Delete Task
3. Update Task
4. View Task List
5. Mark Task as Complete / Incomplete

### Explicit Constraints:
- Storage MUST be in-memory only (Python data structures)
- NO database usage (Neon/Postgres is forbidden in this phase)
- NO web UI
- NO API
- NO AI agents
- Console/CLI interaction only

## Development Methodology (MANDATORY)
Follow Spec-Driven Development using Spec-Kit Plus:
1. Specifications must be written BEFORE implementation
2. Code must be generated ONLY from specs
3. No manual code edits are allowed
4. If output is incorrect, refine the spec, not the code

Use Agentic Dev Stack workflow:
Spec → Plan → Task Breakdown → Claude/Gemini-generated implementation

## Architecture Planning Requirements

The plan MUST include:

### 1. High-level Architecture Sketch (conceptual, text-based)
- CLI entry point
- In-memory task store
- Task entity model
- Command handling flow

### 2. Clean Python Project Structure under `/src`
- Proper module separation
- No monolithic scripts
- Pythonic naming and organization

### 3. Task Identity Strategy
- UUID v4 for task IDs
- IDs must be stable during runtime

## Task Model Requirements
Each Todo task MUST minimally include:
- `id` (uuid4 string)
- `title` (string)
- `description` (string)
- `completed` (boolean)
- `created_at` (datetime, optional but recommended)

## Specification Strategy
Plan MUST define:
- A single maintained specification file for Phase I backend logic
- How specs will evolve without duplication
- How changes are tracked per feature
- Clear acceptance criteria for each feature

DO NOT create unnecessary Markdown files.
Maintain one evolving spec document for Phase I.

## Feature-Level Acceptance Criteria
The plan must outline validation checks for:
- Adding tasks with title and description
- Listing tasks with visible completion status
- Updating task title and description by ID
- Deleting tasks by ID
- Marking tasks complete/incomplete
- Graceful handling of invalid IDs

## Deliverable Structure (Phase I)
The plan must produce the following repository structure:
- Constitution file (already exists)
- `/specs/phase-1/` - Contains Phase I specification
- `/src/` - Python source code only
- `README.md` - Setup instructions, how to run, example usage

## Quality & Validation
The plan must define:
- How correctness is validated without tests (manual CLI verification steps)
- How completion of Phase I is determined
- Clear "Phase I Done" criteria before moving to Phase II

## OUT OF SCOPE (DO NOT PLAN)
- Databases
- Web frameworks
- AI agents
- Kubernetes
- Cloud deployment
- Bonus features

## Output Expectation
Produce a clear, structured Phase I plan containing:
- Architecture sketch
- Task breakdown
- Spec strategy
- Validation approach
- Completion checklist

The plan must be explicit enough that implementation can be fully generated by Claude Code or Gemini CLI WITHOUT further clarification.

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive Phase I planning documentation following Spec-Kit Plus workflow:

**Phase 0 (Research)**: Created research.md resolving all technical decisions including Python 3.12.4 suitability, in-memory storage pattern (Dict[str, Task]), CLI interface design (REPL-style command dispatcher), UUID v4 task ID strategy, dataclass-based Task model, output formatting approach, error handling strategy, and application entry point pattern.

**Phase 1 (Design & Contracts)**: 
- Created data-model.md defining Task entity with full field specifications, validation rules, state transitions, and Python implementations for both Task dataclass and MemoryStore class
- Created quickstart.md providing complete user documentation with setup instructions, command reference, usage examples, error handling guide, and validation checklist
- Updated agent context (copilot-instructions.md) with Phase I technical stack

**Implementation Plan (plan.md)**: Completed comprehensive plan including:
- Technical context (Python 3.12.4, stdlib dependencies, in-memory storage)
- Constitution compliance verification (all 7 sections validated)
- Project structure (src/ layout with models, services, storage, cli modules)
- High-level architecture diagram showing component relationships and data flow
- Implementation workflow (Phases 0-4)
- Feature breakdown (7 core features with acceptance criteria)
- Manual validation strategy (testing checklist)
- Risk mitigation
- Phase I completion checklist

**Feature Specification (spec.md)**: Created detailed specification with:
- Purpose and scope (Phase I boundaries clearly defined)
- 5 functional requirements (FR1-FR5) with acceptance criteria
- Data model definition (Task entity fields and constraints)
- CLI interface requirements (5 commands)
- Non-functional requirements (code quality, UX, performance, structure)
- Validation approach (manual verification steps)
- Technical constraints (Python 3.12.4, no databases, no web, no AI)
- Implementation methodology (spec-driven development)
- Deliverable structure (src/ modules)
- Future evolution notes (Phase II-V out of scope)

All documentation follows Master Constitution v1.0.0 requirements for spec-driven development, minimal documentation strategy, and phase execution rules.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete Phase I planning foundation established with all required documentation (spec, plan, research, data-model, quickstart) ready for task breakdown and implementation generation
- 🧪 Tests: Manual validation strategy defined with comprehensive testing checklist covering all commands, error cases, and integration scenarios
- 📁 Files: 6 files created (spec.md, plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md, copilot-instructions.md)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Run `/sp.tasks` to generate task breakdown (tasks.md), then use Claude Code or Gemini CLI to generate implementation from tasks
- 🧠 Reflection: Planning session successfully executed following Spec-Kit Plus workflow; all Phase 0 unknowns resolved through research; Phase 1 design documents comprehensive; architecture clean and modular supporting future evolution to Phase II; Constitution compliance verified with zero violations

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - all workflow steps completed successfully
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - Constitution Check verified all 7 requirements, spec includes all mandatory sections, plan includes architecture and workflow, research resolved all clarifications
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard planning workflow (setup-plan.ps1 → load context → Phase 0 research → Phase 1 design → update agent context)
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A - planning complete, ready for task breakdown phase
