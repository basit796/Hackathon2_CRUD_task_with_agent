## Prompt
/sp.implement
give my frontend professional look and for this you need to work on small fixes in which first on wis in filter for all task and newest give good animation to it match it with theme going on

## Response snapshot

Enhanced the frontend with professional animations and visual improvements including: (1) Added scale animations and smooth transitions to filter/sort dropdowns with hover effects matching the blue (#3B82F6) theme, (2) Enhanced "New Task" button with rotating plus icon (45° when open) and scale effects, (3) Added blue dot indicator badges on dropdowns when non-default options are selected, (4) Created custom CSS animations (slideInUp, shimmer) in globals.css with improved select styling.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Frontend now has professional-looking animations with smooth transitions, visual feedback indicators, and consistent blue/slate theming throughout the interface
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: Modified frontend/src/App.tsx (added animations, indicators, transitions) and frontend/src/index.css (custom animations and select styling)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Consider adding loading state animations, toast notifications for user actions, or enhanced task card animations
- 🧠 Reflection: Small, purposeful animations with consistent theming significantly elevate perceived professionalism without overwhelming the user

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - request was clear and all animations were successfully implemented matching the existing theme
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - All animations implemented with smooth transitions, proper theme matching, and visual feedback
- Prompt variant (if applicable): none
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Test with users to validate if animation timings (duration-200, duration-300) feel natural or need adjustment
